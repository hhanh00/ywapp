Halo 2 is the latest proving system used by Zcash.
It does not require a [trusted setup](/halo2)
and has optimizations
for [lookup data](/halo2).

The following sections are an
[introduction to zero knowledge proofs](/halo2/intro)
(ZKP). It gives a high level understanding
of the purpose of ZKP and how they are
[used in Zcash](/halo2).

Then we will illustrate Halo 2 programmation via some
[simple examples](/halo2)
and a
[comparison between with traditional programmation](/halo2).
