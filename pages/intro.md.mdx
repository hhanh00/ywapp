Working with ZKP is similar to writing a computer program.

Usually, one writes a program to perform a given task
which is often to do a calculation. A computer does not
directly work on the outside world, it has periphericals
(or devices) that convert external inputs into numbers,
for example, a keyboard or a mouse, and other periphicals
that convert numbers back into external outputs such as
a screen.
