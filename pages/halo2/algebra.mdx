# Vectors

Just like in programming, we can make lists of numbers
and define operations on them.

For example, if you want to write the coordinates
of a point you can use a pair of values: $(x, y)$
If it's in 3D, then we need 3 values.

Coordinates are also good for representing directions.
For example, (1, 5) could be 1 km east and 5 km north.
