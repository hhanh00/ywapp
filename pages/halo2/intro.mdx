In blockchain cryptography, we often need to prove
our identity to perform some operation. For example
if we want to spend some funds, we must prove that
we *own* these funds. With the traditional banking
system, you would show your government ID card
or some other form of official document, but for
cryptocurrencies that are decentralized, there is
no "authority" that delivers these documents.

# Integers

Instead, we rely on cryptography. At the core,
cryptography uses large integer numbers.
Integers are numbers that don't have a decimal point:
1, 2, 3 are integers but 5.3 is not.

<Callout>
Integers can be *precisely* used by a computer. 
Floating numbers, like 1/3 are approximatively
represented. We must be precise when it comes to
cryptocurrencies.

# Finite Fields

Of course, we cannot use *all* the integers because
there is an infinity of them. But if we use a large
range, it is *practically* infinite.

<Callout type="warning">
There will be some hand waving for sure.
</Callout>

The typical range is about $2^{256}$, that is around
$10^{77}$ or 1 followed by 77 zeros. 

Basically, if you use a pick two numbers at random
in that range, the chances of them being equal
is astronomically small. In theory, it is possible
but in practice, it is *never* going to happen.

When you set a cap[^1] on integers and make them 
"wrap around" you observe that most of the 
arithmetic operations work normally.

[^1]: the cap is called the *order* or the *modulus*.

You can add, subtract and multiply these numbers
as long as you "reduce" the result to a number
in the range.

<Callout type="info">
For example, let's say the max is 12. $1 + 2 = 3$
and $7 + 10 = 17 = 5$, because 17 is out of the
range [0, 11], we subtracted 12 to bring it back.
</Callout>

When a number goes below 0, you can bring it back
to the positive range by adding multiples of the cap:
$1 - 2 = -1 = 11$.

> With a max of 12, we have essentially the hours of 
a clock. 2 hours before 1 pm is 11 am.

Multiplication works too: $5*6 = 30 = 6 + 2*12 = 6$,
after adjustment[^2].

[^2]: For multiplications, you may have to add/subtract
multiples of the max.

Division is a bit different. Division is the same thing
as multiplication by the inverse. However, the inverse
of an integer is not an integer (except for 1). So
how can we divide?

For unlimited integers, division is not defined. But
when there is a cap, sometimes we can find an integer
such as the product by it is 1: i.e. some numbers have an
inverse. It depends on the number and the cap.

For example, if the cap is 5 and the number is 2:
$2 \times 3 = 6 = 1$, therefore 3 is the inverse of 2!
Likewise 2 is the inverse of 3. What about 4?
$4 x 4 = 16 = 1$. So 4 is its own inverse, like for 1.

If the cap is 12, 2 has no inverse. Because any integer
multiply by 2 is going to be even and after reduction
by 12 will remain even. It cannot be equal to 1.

In cryptography, we use a cap that is very large and
yet chosen such as every number has an inverse (except 0).

This is possible by picking a large prime number[^3].

> The set of integers with a cap (or modulus) of p
is written as GF(p).

GF stands for Galois Field in hommage to the mathematician
Galois. They are also called **Finite Fields**.

Most of the time, p is a prime number because then, every
element of GF(p) has an inverse (except 0)[^4].

In the rest, we will assume that every number is in GF(p).
We do not use floating point numbers or unlimited integers.
Always some number in GF(p)[^5].

Next, we'll look at list and tables of numbers: vectors
and matrices.

## Footnotes

[^3]: Prime numbers are integers that only have 1 and themselves
as dividers. The smallest prime is 2. It goes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13...
9 is not a prime because $3 x 3 = 9$.
[^4]: This is not obvious but can be proven with group theory.
[^5]: Not always the same $p$. If it's important, we'll indicate which
one it is.
