This section is a "gentle" introduction
to the cryptography used in Zcash such as
hashes, commitments, elliptic curve cryptography,
and zero knowledge proofs.

Feel free to skip this since you do not
need to know any of that to use Ywallet.
Otherwise, let's get started with some history.

## Basic Cipher

Cryptography is a very old science. The Romans
were using it but it probably dates from far
before them.

If you ever felt the need to exchange a message
with someone without other people being able
to read it, then you needed cryptography.

Like most of the examples, we'll use Alice and Bob
as the two actors in our hypothetical scenarios.

Alice wants to give a message to Bob but she does
want anyone but Bob to read it even if it gets
intercepted.

She invents a system where she replaces each
letter of the original message (the plaintext)
by moving it down the alphabet: A becomes B,
B becomes C, etc. finally Z becomes A.

HELLO BOB becomes IFMMP CPC (the ciphertext). 
If Charlie reads the ciphertext, he will not
understand anything. Bob decrypts the message
by moving each letter up one rank.

Even though this is a simple encryption method,
it shows the properties of real encryption:

- the plaintext is encrypted into the ciphertext
- the ciphertext is decrypted back into the plaintext
- both Alice and Bob must agree on the encryption method

Typically, encryption methods (called ciphers) have
a parameter, so that the same cipher can be used
by other people. For example, Alice may choose to
shift the letters by 3 instead of 1: A becomes D, etc.

If Bob does not know that Alice used 3 instead of 1,
he would not recover the original message. That parameter
is critical in the decryption process. Ideally,
a cipher should be designed so that knowing the **KEY**
is required.

## Digests

Let's assume for a minute that our cipher is good[^1].
Charlie can intercept messages but he cannot understand
them. However, he can still cause trouble by modifying
it and passing it on to Bob. Bob decrypts the message
and may believe that it came unaltered from Alice.

To prevent that, Alice should add a *digest* to the 
ciphertext[^2]. The digest is a value that is computed
from the content of the ciphertext and the key 
such as any modification in the ciphertext will 
lead to a different digest. An attacker cannot
forge a new digest because they need the key as well.

These digests typically involve using *hash functions*.

## Hash Function

A Hash Function takes a message and derives a 
fixed length output value (16, 32, 64 bytes): the hash.

To be cryptographically worthy, a hash function must have
the following properties:

- The hash is "impredictable". Even the slightest
change in the message will lead to a completely
different hash;
- "Reversing" the function, i.e. finding another
message that has the same hash is impossible[^3];
- Even finding *any* two messages that have the same hash
is impossible.

Hash Functions are extremely useful. For example,
they can serve as a proxy for a message[^4].

## Footnotes

[^1]: Our cipher is pretty bad. First, the key 
can only take 25 different values: 1 to 25. Shifting
by 26 letters will bring it back to the original message
since there are only 26 letters in the alphabet.
Second, each letter is always replaced by the same letter
in the entire message. If Charlie knows the language,
he can easily figure out the substitutions by looking
for patterns in the ciphertext. For example repeated
letters like IF**MM**P are likely going to be L, M, S.
It cannot be M because a letter can be substituted by itself...
[^2]: The digest could also be calculated over the plaintext.
[^3]: Impossible in the pragmatic sense. It will take trillions
of years or longer...
[^4]: Instead of signing the full message, you can 
sign its hash. The message cannot be tampered without
modifying the hash. Signing a hash means "I certify that I wrote the message
that has a hash value of XYZ". It is as good as saying: 
"I certify I wrote this whole message"
