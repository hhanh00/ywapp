Maintaining a safe backup is extremely
important.

<Callout type = "warning">
Without a backup, your funds are irremediably
**LOST** in case of a hardware or software failure.
</Callout>

Ywallet supports two types of backups:
- By [seed phrase](/backup/seed)
or secret key
- By saving an encrypted copy of its
[database](/backup/app)

Each has its own benefits and drawbacks.
But you should at least have one type of backup.
