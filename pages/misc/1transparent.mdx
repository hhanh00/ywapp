Transparent wallets have the concept of a *one-time address*, which is supposed
to receive funds only once. On the blockchain, this address appears only once in
each direction, resulting in a transaction history that is limited to a maximum
of two entries: one deposit and one withdrawal. This process significantly
reduces the traceability of transactions, thereby enhancing the wallet's
anonymity.

However, they have multiple issues. 

1. Every new transparent address slows down synchronization. Transparent
synchronization is much quicker than shielded synchronization since the remote
server can use a database index, but it is not cost-free. 
1. The wallet must keep the derivation path of the one-time addresses;
otherwise, it will regenerate the same address twice. However, when the user
recovers from the seed phrase or transfers from another wallet, they will often
not know which paths they used. This happened to most users of Zecwallet when
they brought their wallet over.
1. The new wallet can scan a range of derivation paths, but this may only return
some of the one-time addresses[^1], or consider a one time address unused when
it was already handed out[^2]. All in all, it is much more preferable to use
Zcash's native privacy mechanism: Shielded addresses.
1. Chain analysis tools use powerful heuristics that defeat one-time addresses.
Often, they can link transactions based on other characteristics such as time
and amount.

The only use case I can think of is a CEX that only supports transparent
addresses. In this case, you may be interested in the workflow described in the
section [CEX](./cex).

<Callout type="info"> Ywallet is unlikely to directly support one-time
addresses. </Callout>

**Users are urged to shield their funds instead.**

The [Keytool](/tools/key_derivation) and the [Sweep](/tools/sweep) are useful
tools for working with them.

[^1]: There may be a more extensive range of unused addresses than expected.
[^2]: They could have given out one-time addresses that do not have transactions
yet.
