<Callout>
There are TWO polls to allow the highest number of people to participate.
Some people were not aware that the first poll snapshot was already taken
and are unable to participate. We are running a second poll *concurrently*
to allow them to join the vote.

## FAQ

1. Who can vote? 
To vote, you must have funds in the Orchard Pool created after block height 
2540000 and before block height 2557150, i.e. *The Registration Window RW*.
Moreover, the funds must be unspent as of block height 2557150.
1. If I don't have funds in the *The Registration Window* can I still
participate?
No, the window is closed now. Even if you move funds, it will not be 
eligible. You may have some funds in the RW, it may be worth checking.
1. Can I spent my funds now?
Yes, moving funds after the RW has no effect on your voting power.
1. Can I vote for more than one proposal?
Yes, but with different notes. You simply repeat the voting process.
1. What *weight* does my vote have?
Your vote is weighted by *the total amount of coins of the notes* you
spent to cast it.
