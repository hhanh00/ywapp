![Restore](./new/2024-03-06_00-48-03.png)

1. Turn on the restore switch
1. Enter the wallet key
1. Choose the account index.
The account index is part of the derivation path. This is *NOT* the wallet
birth height (see below). If you are unsure, leave it at 0
1. Press to restore the account

The account is created but the blockchain data is not
[rescanned](/sync/rescan).

Therefore you will not see your balance yet.

<Callout>
Usually after an import, the wallet has to
[rescan](/sync/rescan) older blocks.
If you are restoring multiple accounts, it is recommended
to rescan *after* you imported them all
because the rescan will process all the accounts simulatenously.
