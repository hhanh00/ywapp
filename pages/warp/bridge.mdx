Most of the time, you get blocks
of note commitments that do not contain
new received notes.
In that case, you just want to update
the witnesses with the new block data.
Normally, that would require hashing
the new note commitments and updating
the commitment tree.

Bridges are pre-calculated hashes
that enable us to update the witnesses
*without* computing any hash. 

<Callout>
Using a Bridge is **much** faster than
doing the computation normally.
</Callout>

Even better, the bridges are calculated
server side and can be used by any client
anonymously, i.e. they don't leak privacy.

With a Bridge, we want to capture the
data needed to update witnesses
and to update the tree state. We
are not required to handle new received
notes therefore we do not need the internal
hash values.

- For the witnesses, we need the first node
of each level *if* it is the right node of
a pair[^1].
- For the tree state, we need the last node
of each level *if* it is the left node of a 
pair[^2].

## Merging Bridges

Continuous bridges can be merged by taking
the head of the first bridge and the tail
of the second one.

## Applying a Bridge

After a bridge is applied to the witnesses
and the tree state is updated, we can
continue processing nodes normally.

Warp 2 mixes bridges and normal processing.
We receive compact blocks that have both data,
we search new received notes.

If we find any, we use the normal processing
path since we have to add new witnesses.
Otherwise, we use the bridge to quickly update
the existing witnesses.

At the end, the tree reaches the same state.

## Footnotes
[^1]: If it is the left node, we have a new
full pair.
[^2]: That's the same logic as before.
