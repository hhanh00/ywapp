Zero Knowledge Proofs are the "secret sauce" of 
Zcash and possibly where it differs from other
private coins the most.

It may be a new concept therefore it is worth
spending some time getting to know them.

## Zero Knowledge Proofs

Let's say you have make calculation, starting
from a value $x$. Let's say for example

$$x^3 + x + 5$$

And the value of $x$ you use is 3[^1].

The result is $3^3 + 3 + 5 = 27 + 3 + 5 = 35$.

Consider the challenge:

<Callout>
Prove that we know $x$ such as
$$x^3 + x + 5 = 35$$

but without revealing $x = 3$.
</Callout>

That's the problem what Zero Knowledge Proofs solve!

## Formal Definition

You take a computation $F(x)$, here $F(x) = x^3+x+5$.

The ZKP program transforms F into two new functions P and V,
such as:

### Proving Program P

P takes x, c and returns a "proof" p: $P(x, c) = p$.
The person who wants to prove knowledge of x calculates P(3, 35) 
to get the proof p.

### Verification Program V

The verifier, in this case every full node that checks the
transaction, runs the Verification Program V that takes
p and c as inputs and outputs a true/false value.

The program V returns true if and only if the proof checks
out relative of c.

$$V(p, 35) = \text{true}$$

## Using a proving system

The proving system can do more than work with a single input
value $x$. It supports multiple secret values and multiple
assertions.

In Zcash, the secret values are for example the output
note address and value (x), and the parameters (c) are
the hashes.

The sender uses the proving system to generate a proof
that he knows the values of the address and the amount
such as the commitment that he substituted for the output note
matches.

If he tries to be dishonest and change the value of the note,
the proof will not check out and the verifier will reject
the transaction[^2].

## Zero Knowledge Statements

Let's see what the ZKP statements enforce:
- the nullifier is calculated properly from note commitment
(and other hidden values);
- the transaction inputs spend notes that were created
before. With transparent transactions, it was checked
by looking up the input transaction id and output index
in the database. With shielded transactions, the ZKP
states that the nullifier corresponds to a previous commitment;
- note output address is calculated correctly
- the transaction input and output values are equal[^3][^4].

> At this point, we have a system that encrypts and hides
the transaction inputs and outputs while allowing verifiers
to check that the consensus rules were followed.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Any calculation made by a computer
is eventually just a combination of arithmetic
operations. We don't lose generality by using
this simple expression.
[^2]: It also relies on the fact that it is impossible
to find another note that would have the same commitment
by the binding property of the hash function.
[^3]: In reality, the values are *not* equal because
the transaction can have transparent parts as well.
For instance, a transaction can have transparent inputs
and shielded outputs. In this case, we would have shielded
outputs that exceeds the shielded inputs. The system
checks that the sum of all inputs (transparent & shielded)
equals the sum of all outputs (transparent & shielded) plus
the mining fees.
[^4]: Input and output amounts are more complex that explained
here. They have a *value commitment* that works similarly to
note commitments but take only the amount. The ZKP guarantees
that the value commitment is computed correctly.
These commitments have an extra property. They preserve
additive equalities. In other words, $V(a) + V(b) = V(a + b)$.
Then even though the verifier only has value commitments to work with,
they can check that the sum of inputs/outputs values are equal
using the value commitments.
