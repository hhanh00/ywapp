Transparent Transactions are relatively easy to 
understand and implement but they have a 
significant issue: 

> The blockchain contains all the Transactions
in clear. It is possible to follow
any address and analyze its history.

Privacy coins, such as Zcash, aim to prevent
blockchain analysis by hiding addresses and amounts.

But, how can they do it while keeping the consistency
rules of transparent transactions?

First, transaction outputs are *encrypted* with a key
that only the recipient (and the sender) knows.
However, once the output is encrypted, no one else
can read the output. The address and the amounts are 
perfectly hidden but now validators have no obvious
mechanism for verifying that the transaction is
right.

## Commitments

So, in place of the transaction outputs, we have
*note commitments*.

A note commitment is a hash of the address and the value
of the note[^1].

This hash has two very important properties:
- it *hides* the address and the value of the note.
Knowing the hash gives no information about the note itself;
- it *commits* to the note. The hash function is designed
so that it is practically impossible with our technology
to find another note that has the same hash.

## Nullifiers

Then, in place of the transaction inputs, we have *note
nullifiers*.

These are also hashes but calculated from the note commitment
and a secret key only known by the sender.

<Callout>
Commitments and Nullifiers are different for the same note!
It is actually extremely unlikely we will ever see a commitment
equal to a nullifier. Even so, it would not mean that they are
coming from the same note.
</Callout>

## Validation Process

**If the sender is honest**, a transaction can be verified
by running the following algorithm[^2]:
- Check that the nullifier was not used previously
- Check the signatures on the inputs

That's it! Validators can no longer verify that the transaction
has less output value that input value, nor that the 
output address is well-formed, because inputs and outputs
are now *hashes*, and hashes perfectly hide all the properties
of the note.

Validators can only check that the inputs are unspent,
because there is just one nullifier for a given note.
If the sender uses the same note twice, they would use
the same nullifier twice too.

Now, validators can check that the transaction is not
*double spending* but they do not know what output
was spent.

However, obviously we cannot build a cryptocurrency
based on the honest behavior of every participants.

In the next section, we will see how Zcash makes sure
that participants *MUST* behave properly.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Other elements are included in the hash
that make it unique even if the address and amount
are the same between two notes. We'll not discuss
these because they are not fundamental at our level
of understanding.
[^2]: Some details are omitted for simplicity.
